<h2 style="text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading">Guided E-Learning Community Portal â€“ Purchase Terms</h2>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h3><strong>1. Our contract with you</strong></h3>
<p>1.1 These Purchase Terms apply to any digital content and services (including Packages, as defined in our website terms and conditions) purchased directly via the Portal (&#8220;<strong>Products</strong>&#8221; and each a &#8220;<strong>Product</strong>&#8220;), in addition our website terms and conditions of use.</p>
<p>1.2 If you purchased any products, services or study packages from your school or other third party, you should refer to the relevant payment terms of that school and/or third party for the details of the terms governing your contract with them.</p>
<p>1.3 Please read these Purchase Terms, together with our website terms and conditions of use carefully before you submit your order to us. These Purchase Terms tell you how we will provide our Products to you, how you and we may change or end the contract, what to do if there is a problem, the extent of our liability to you and other important information. If you think that there is a mistake in these Purchase Terms or require any changes, please contact us to discuss.</p>
<p>1.4 Our acceptance of your purchase order will take place when we email you to accept it, at which point a contract will come into existence between you and us.</p>
<p>1.5 If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the Product. This might be because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for or because we are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified.</p>
<p>1.6 We will assign an order number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Your rights to make changes</strong></h3>
<p>2.1 If you wish to make a change to your order please contact us. We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible we will let you know about any changes to the price of the order, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change. If we cannot make the change or the consequences of making the change are unacceptable to you, you may want to end the contract.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Providing the products</strong></h3>
<p>3.1 During the order process we will let you know when we will provide the Products to you.</p>
<p>3.2 If our supply of the Products is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any products you have paid for but not received.</p>
<p>3.3 We may need certain information from you so that we can supply the products to you, for example, the registration information. If so, this will have been stated in the description of the Products on the Portal. We will contact you to ask for this information. If you do not give us this information within a reasonable time of us asking for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying the Products late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</p>
<p>3.4 We may have to suspend the supply of a Product to:</p>
<p>(a) deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes;</p>
<p>(b) update the Product to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements;</p>
<p>(c) make changes to the Product as requested by you or notified by us to you.</p>
<p>3.5 We will contact you in advance to tell you we will be suspending supply of the Product, unless the problem is urgent or an emergency. If we have to suspend the Product for a period longer than 24 hours, we will extend the contract period by the period of suspension at no additional cost to you.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Your rights to end the contract</strong></h3>
<p>4.1 Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract:</p>
<p>(a) If you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do, see clause 4.2;</p>
<p>(b) If you have just changed your mind about the Product, see clause 4.3. You may be able to get a refund if you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to deductions;</p>
<p>(c) In all other cases (if we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind), see clause 4.6.</p>
<p>4.2 If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at (a) to (e) below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any Products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:</p>
<p>(a) we have told you about an upcoming change to the Product or these terms which you do not agree to;</p>
<p>(b) we have told you about an error in the price or description of the Product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;</p>
<p>(c) there is a risk that supply of the Products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;</p>
<p>(d) we have suspended supply of the Products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than 30 days; or</p>
<p>(e) you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</p>
<p>4.3 For most Products bought online you have a legal right under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 to change your mind within 14 days (&#8220;<strong>cooling off period</strong>&#8220;) and receive a refund.</p>
<p>4.4 You do not have a right to change your mind in respect of:</p>
<p>(a) digital products after you have started to download or stream these; or</p>
<p>(b) services (including Packages), once these have been completed, even if the cancellation period is still running.</p>
<p>4.5 How long you have to change your mind depends on what you have ordered and how it is delivered:</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Purchased services (including Packages)?</strong> If so, you have 14 days after the day we email you to confirm we accept your order. However, once we have completed the services, for example you have completed an extra tutorial, you cannot change your mind, even if the period is still running. If you cancel after we have started the services, and you have requested the services to be provided before the end of the cooling off period,we may deduct from any refund an amount for the supply of the service for the period for which it was supplied, ending with the time when you told us you had changed your mind. The amount will be in proportion to what has been supplied, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Purchased digital content for download or streaming?</strong> If so, you have 14 days after the day we email you to confirm we accept your order, or, if earlier, until you start downloading or streaming. If we delivered the digital content to you immediately, and you agreed to this when ordering, you will not have a right to change your mind.</p>
<p>4.6 We will refund you the price you paid for the Products, by the method you used for payment.</p>
<p>4.7 We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible, and in any event within 14 days of your telling us you have changed your mind.</p>
<h3><strong>5. How to end the contract with us (including if you have changed your mind)</strong></h3>
<p>5.1 To end the contract with us, please let us know by doing one of the following:</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Phone or email</strong>. Call customer services email us at <a href="mailto:support@guidedelearning.com">support@guidedelearning.com</a>. Please provide your name, home address, details of the order and, where available, your phone number and email address.</p>
